# Rewards & Inflation

For staking users in the dfinance network getting rewards in XFI coins. Validators receive rewards by generating and signing new blocks, they take a commission, it's their default reward for supporting the network. 

Delegators that delegate XFI to validators also receive rewards in proportion to the amount of their staked XFI. 

Read more about the inflation and rewards model supported by the dfinance network in the current documentation.

## Inflation

Dfinance inflation model is in the final stage, but not released yet, this why we will not describe it in the current version of the documentation, to don't make misunderstood, we will make an explanation once it released. The release planned during summer 2020.

Current testnet using default inflation from Cosmos network, if you are interested in how it works, we provide links, so you can learn:

    * [Cosmos Mint Module Overview](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/mint/)
    * [Cosmos Inflation & Staking Rewards](https://figment.network/resources/cosmos-inflation-staking-rewards-how-are-they-related)

Also, the module responsible for inflation is `mint`, so look at currently available commands:

```bash
# To see query commands.
dncli q mint --help

# To see tx commands.
dncli tx mint --help
```

## Rewards

Use [wallet](https://wallet.testnet.dfinance.co) to see & withdraw rewards or continue with **dncli**.

See `distribution` module:

```bash
# To see query commands.
dncli q distribution

# To see tx commands.
dncli tx distribution
```

To check if you have any rewards use next command:

```bash
dncli q distribution rewards [delegator-addr] [<validator-addr>]
```

Where:

    * [delegator-addr] - address of delegator. 
    * [<validator-addr>] - address of validator. Optional.

If you are validator, see earned commission:

```bash
dncli q distribution commission [validator]
```

To withdraw rewards send transaction:

```bash
dncli tx distribution withdraw-all-rewards --from [account]
```

Where:

    * [account] - is an account that has rewards.
