# DFI Coin

**DFI** is the main currency in **dfinance** network.

DFI is used for:
- PoS
- staking
- fees

## Decimals

DFI coin has 18 decimals places, which means 1.0 DFI can be represented as integer as **1000000000000000000**, while 0.**000000000000000001 DFI** as 1 as integer.

When working with **dncli** amounts need to be integers, so convert your amount to integer before executing any command.

As it's the same 18 decimals places, like in ETH, you can use same resources to convert amounts, [like this one](https://www.etherchain.org/tools/unitConverter) (use ether-wei pair).
