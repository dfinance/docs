## What is dfinance

**dfinance** \[diːfaɪˈnæns\] is a truly decentralized infrastructure dedicated to various financial and DeFi instruments and products designed for people.

Our infrastructure on the one hand adopts all the properties of a good blockchain: high transaction throughput with low latency, unconstrained scalability, granular security and quite well designed smart contracts engine. On the other hand it proposes a simple and solid set of instruments to engage all you knowledge in finances on the way to success of your project.

We proudly offer you to employ the **dfinance** infrastructure to publish your ideas and focus on your aim.
